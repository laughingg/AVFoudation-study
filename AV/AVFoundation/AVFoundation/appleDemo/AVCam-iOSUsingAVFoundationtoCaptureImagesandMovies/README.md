# AVCam-iOS: Using AVFoundation to Capture Photos and Movies

AVCam demonstrates how to use the AVFoundation capture API to record movies and capture photos. The sample has a record button for recording movies, a photo button for capturing photos, a Live Photo mode button for enabling Live Photo capture, a capture mode control for toggling between photo and movie capture modes, and a camera button for switching between front and back cameras (on supported devices). AVCam runs only on an actual device, either an iPad or iPhone, and cannot be run in Simulator.
